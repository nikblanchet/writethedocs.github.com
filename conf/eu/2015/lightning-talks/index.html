<h3 id="lightning-talks">Lightning Talks</h3>
<p>A lightning talk is a very short talk where you share an idea, concept,
or a bit of information you find interesting. They’re quick, easy, and a
great way to practice. (Lovely example
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=6wcP1aMl7wQ#t=942"><em>here</em></a>!)</p>
<h3 id="planning-what-goes-into-a-lightning-talk">Planning: What Goes into a Lightning Talk?</h3>
<p>A lightning talk should be about <strong>five minutes long</strong>, just long enough
to give an overview and make people curious about your topic. You can
talk about anything that’s related to the event’s general theme (in the
case of Write the Docs, anything even remotely related to documentation).</p>
<p>First, you need a <strong>topic</strong>. Your topic might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A concept, process, or tool that you learned recently or are still
    learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An idea for a website or product that would solve a problem you have</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A retrospective, or what went right/wrong during a project you did
    or are doing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anything relevant that the audience might be interested in knowing
    more about</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, you need an <strong>outline</strong> for the content. Think about the
<strong>audience</strong>, and the <strong>goal</strong> of your talk. Choose points to make that
will be understandable by the audience and achieve your presentation
goal. Remember how quickly five minutes goes by when choosing what to
include!</p>
<p>Potential <strong>points of interest</strong> might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What could you use this for or when could you use it? Have you
    already used it? How?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When wouldn't it not be as useful? What are some contraindications
    to using it?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources related to the subject, including books, documentation,
    and URLs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are there any projects or companies that are using what you're
    sharing?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this something you'd like to collaborate with others on? Feel
    free to ASK!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some of the challenges related to using, building, or
    configuring what you're showing?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preparation-slides-are-optional">Preparation: Slides are Optional</h3>
<p>You absolutely don’t need slides. However, if you’d like to make slides,
use anything that you are comfortable with. Don’t worry if it doesn’t
look polished, lightning talks don’t need to be! You might use Microsoft
Word, Keynote, a PDF, or a web site. Even a simple terminal or console
window where you enter commands can work well for presenting your ideas.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the projector will be lower resolution, typically
1024x768, and that low-contrast slides don't present well. You’ll also
need to make your terminal or console font very large so that everyone
can see what you’re typing. If you're running code examples, have them
written, debugged, and ready to go. Watching someone write code as they
go can be great in a longer deep-dive type of talk, but it's not very
well-suited to a lightning talk.</p>
<h3 id="live-demos-proceed-at-your-own-risk">Live Demos: Proceed at Your Own Risk</h3>
<p>You may have the urge to do a live demonstration of the thing you’re
talking about. It seems like an easy way to help the audience see your
vision, and it is… if it works! Following Murphy’s Law, however, we can
deduce that your live demo will go horribly wrong. A failed demo can
derail all but the most skilled presenters, but if you choose to do a
demo and it goes wrong don’t worry! Have a backup story to tell that
explains what the demo would have shown and revert to it if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="presenting-your-own-five-minutes-on-stage">Presenting: Your Own Five Minutes on Stage!</h3>
<p>Take a deep breath and go for it. You are among friends, and nobody will
mind if you make mistakes. Almost everyone starts out their public
speaking career in the tech industry by giving lightning talks, so you
can assume your audience has been in your shoes before. Throw caution to
the wind and embrace your five minutes! :)</p>
<p>Be sure to bring everything you need to do your presentation. It’s wise
to assume that the internet access will fail precisely when you need it.
Load web pages you need into your browser beforehand. Bring the adapters
you'd normally need to connect your laptop to a monitor or projector,
and keep a backup copy of your presentation on a USB memory stick –
laptops can and do fail, and this will allow you to use someone else’s
laptop if the need arises.</p>
<h3 id="finishing-up">Finishing up</h3>
<p>If you have your slide presentation or example code available online you
can let the group know where to find it if you want to share it. Curious
people may follow up with you if they’d like to collaborate or have
feedback about your presentation.</p>
